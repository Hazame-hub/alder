# Decisions

An append-only record of decisions that were settled once and should not be
relitigated. Each entry says what was chosen and, more usefully, why the
alternative was rejected.

If you settle something non-obvious — especially somewhere the code turned out
to contradict the plan — add an entry.

### 2026-09-02 — bootstrap

- **Module path** is `github.com/hazame-hub/alder`. Confirmed before `go mod init`.
- **Schema editing stays out of v1.** It was requested early and the scope line was held. Schema is *browsable* and *exportable as LDIF* in v1. Nothing
  writes to `cn=schema` / `cn=config` until v2. Reason: schema writes are the most
  vendor-divergent operation in LDAP (OpenLDAP `cn=config` `olcObjectClasses`
  versus 389 DS `cn=schema` modify), and doing it once, correctly, requires the
  conformance harness to already be green.
- **Milestone cadence** is one milestone per review.
- **M0 adds no third-party dependencies.** `internal/dn` and `internal/filter` are
  stdlib-only, and `cmd/alder` is a stub. Cobra, Fiber and `go-ldap/ldap/v3`
  arrive in M1/M2 when there is something for them to do. `go.mod` has an empty
  require block on purpose.
- **Test harness suffix is `dc=alder,dc=test` on both servers.** Because the suffix
  is identical, the seed data LDIF is byte-identical for OpenLDAP and 389 DS, and
  only the schema-installation step is vendor-specific. This is what makes
  "assert identical behaviour" a meaningful assertion rather than a translation
  exercise.

### 2026-09-02 — M1 through M4, in one pass

- **The milestone cadence was collapsed once,** deliberately: M1 to M4 ran back to
  back rather than stopping for review at each. One milestone per review remains
  the default; that was an exception, not a new rule.
- **Go floor raised from 1.23 to 1.25.** `go-ldap/ldap/v3` v3.4.14 and the current
  `golang.org/x/crypto` both declare `go 1.25`. The alternative was pinning older
  versions of both, which means running older TLS code to satisfy a line in a
  document. CI and the Dockerfile follow. The floor is 1.25.
- **`AnsibleTask()` is `ansible.Task(ch)`, not a method on `ChangeRecord`.**
  The original design had it as a method, but `internal/ansible` has to import
  `internal/directory` for the type, so a method on the type would be an import
  cycle. `LDIF()` stays a method because `internal/ldif` has its own record type
  and does not import `directory`. The rule that mattered — one record, one write
  path, two renderings of the same thing — is intact.
- **Spec-first was kept.** `api/openapi.yaml` generates the Go server interface
  (oapi-codegen, models + fiber-server) and the TypeScript client
  (openapi-typescript + openapi-fetch). Handlers are hand-written against the
  generated interface: generated handler bodies would have to be edited to do
  anything, and an edited generated file is the worst of both worlds.
- **DNs are query and body parameters, never path segments.** A DN carries commas,
  equals signs, escaped characters and non-ASCII text, and no two proxies agree
  about double-encoding one. `/entry?dn=...`, not `/entries/{dn}`.
- **An attribute value on the wire is `{text}` or `{base64}`, never a bare string.**
  The choice is made from the bytes and the syntax together, so a JPEG whose
  leading bytes happen to be printable is still base64.
- **The LDIF preview is rendered by the server, not the browser.** Rendering it
  client-side would reintroduce the gap between what the user confirmed and what
  the server was sent, which is the one thing this product cannot have.
- **`replace` is the modification an edit produces,** rather than a computed pair
  of add and delete. The resulting LDIF reads "this attribute ends up as exactly
  this", which is what the user is being asked to confirm.
- **LDIF import applies one record at a time.** A directory has no transaction
  across entries, so a bulk apply that fails halfway leaves a state nobody chose.
  Applied records are marked so a partial run resumes rather than restarts.
- **`attr:< url` in LDIF is refused outright, not fetched.** The reader runs in a
  process holding a privileged bind; following a URL would be arbitrary file
  disclosure and server-side request forgery in one feature. LDAP controls in LDIF
  are refused for a related reason: ignoring one silently would apply a different
  change than the document describes.
- **The conformance suite is behind a `conformance` build tag** so `go test ./...`
  needs no Docker, and runs as a required CI job. It is green on both servers,
  with zero schema parse failures across 389 DS's 1026 attribute types and
  OpenLDAP's 293.
- **Still out of scope, and still not built:** schema editing, ACL or `cn=config`
  editing, any multi-user concept, SSO, a persisted audit log, other drivers,
  bulk provisioning, self-service, a database. v1 remains stateless.

### 2026-09-02 — M5, and the licence

- **AGPL-3.0-only.** Chosen over Apache-2.0 and MPL-2.0 deliberately. Alder is
  run as a service, so section 13 is the operative clause: someone who modifies
  Alder and offers it to others over a network has to offer them the source. That
  is what keeps `test/compose` and `test/conformance` — the expensive part, and
  the thing that makes multi-vendor support real rather than aspirational — from
  being absorbed into a closed product. It also leaves dual-licensing open,
  which the "no licensing or paywall plumbing" line in the scope list implies may
  matter later; that requires staying the sole copyright holder or collecting a
  CLA, so decide before accepting outside contributions.
- **Section 13 is discharged in the product, not the README.** `/api/v1/source`
  serves the offer with no session required, and the UI links it in the header.
  The obligation runs to the person using the running instance, and that person
  is looking at the page, not at a repository. `--source-url` is how an operator
  running a fork points it at their own source; the offer also reports whether
  the binary was built from a modified tree.
- **GoReleaser does not build the SPA.** `embed.FS` resolves at compile time, so
  a `before` hook would let a local `goreleaser build` silently ship whichever
  SPA the developer last built. The release workflow runs `task web` first and
  GoReleaser asserts the output exists, failing loudly if it does not.
- **The editor holds a frozen baseline.** It used to derive one from the live
  query, so any refetch discarded in-progress edits. Freezing it also made
  refetching useful: it is what detects another admin changing the entry
  underneath, which the editor now reports rather than silently overwriting.
- **`--warning-tint-foreground` exists because `--warning-foreground` is for
  text on a solid fill.** Every warning panel in the app is a 10% tint over the
  page background, where the solid-fill colour was dark-on-dark in dark mode.

### 2026-09-03 — the contributor licence agreement

- **A CLA, not a copyright assignment.** Contributors keep their copyright and
  grant a licence that explicitly includes the right to sublicense under any
  terms, which is the clause dual-licensing depends on. Assignment would give
  the Maintainer more, and most contributors and nearly every employer refuse it
  on sight; the licence grant buys everything the AGPL decision was made for at
  a fraction of the friction. Adapted from the Apache ICLA v2.0, which
  contributors already recognise.
- **The reason is stated in the first paragraph of the document, not buried.**
  A CLA that hides why it exists reads like a rights grab. This one says it lets
  the Maintainer relicense, and says on the same screen that the contributor
  keeps their copyright.
- **The counterparty is the GitHub account, for now, and the document says so.**
  A grant to an account name is weaker than one to a named person or company.
  It is defined once, at the top, so replacing it with a legal name is a
  one-line change rather than a redraft; contributions accepted meanwhile stay
  governed by the version signed at the time.
- **Enforced by a bot on every pull request, not by an honour-system note.** The
  option this whole arrangement protects is destroyed permanently by a single
  unsigned contribution, so it cannot depend on the maintainer remembering to
  check. Signatures live as JSON on the `cla-signatures` branch, so who agreed
  to what, and when, is in git rather than in a third-party service.
- **Timing mattered.** The CLA went in before the repository accepted any
  outside contribution, which is the only moment it is free to do.
